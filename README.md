 **App description**
 ***
 
 I should create an application that retrieves data from one or more open APIs and displays this data on an HTML page. I chose to make an application which search through Brewdog's expansive back catalogue of beer in a programmatic way.  
 
 
 **Functionality**
 ***
 
 ##### **User allows**
 
 + Fillter beers by
   + all beers
   + malt
   + hops
 + Search and pairs beer with food
   
  
 **Workflow**
 ***
 
 My plan was to organize this project according to MVC pattern, where in model I put my modules that take care of the logic that is behind the functionality. Controller is used as listener and responds to user requests. In View, I have functionality that manipulates DOM.
 
 Then in the Beer module I have used Module Pattern. Throughout the project, I tried to program according to Functional Programming, where I built my functions to take care of an task only and that they did not contaminate global space.
 
 The root endpoint should prefix all resources:
 ```javascript
 https://api.punkapi.com/v2/
 ```
 All parameters are optional and without them the API will just return the beers in ascending order from their ID. Parameters are passed in as a query string and can be chained together.
 
 All beer endpoints return a json array with a number of beer objects inside.

The project was very instructive and I greatly expanded my knowledge of asynchronous JS and AJAX.
